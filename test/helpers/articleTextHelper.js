Rubin</a> </span> <span> December 21, 2016 4:00 AM </span> </div> <h2> Conceived as a government watchdog with noble aims, the CFPB was doomed by a structure that made it an inherently political agency. <span></span> </h2> <div> <p><span>O</span>n October 11, 2016, in <em>PHH Corp. v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,</em> a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals found the CFPB&#x2019;s structure unconstitutional and &#x201C;fixed&#x201D; it by empowering the president to remove the agency&#x2019;s director at will. Sounds dull, but this is a tragic story.</p> <p><span>Metamorphosis</span><br> In 1988, during my first year of law school, I met a young professor named Elizabeth Warren. She was like a tornado &#x2014; energetic, fascinating, and scary. She was also a Republican. Despite that last bit of trivia, she hadn&#x2019;t changed much when Americans began to notice her two decades later.</p> <div></div><p>In fact, a Reagan Republican might have written her 2007 article &#x201C;<a href="http://democracyjournal.org/magazine/5/unsafe-at-any-rate/" target="_blank">Unsafe at Any Rate</a>,&#x201D; which proposed a new regulatory agency to help consumers understand credit products by simplifying disclosures and ending deceptive industry practices. Free-market economists would approve of her rationale for a &#x201C;Financial Product Safety Commission:&#x201D;</p> <blockquote> <p>To be sure, creating safer marketplaces is not about protecting consumers from all possible bad decisions. . . . Terms hidden in the fine print or obscured with incomprehensible language, unexpected terms, reservation of all power to the seller with nothing left for the buyer, and similar tricks and traps have no place in a well-functioning market. . . . </p> <p>When markets work, they produce value for both buyers and sellers, both borrowers and lenders. But the basic premise of any free market is full information. When a lender can bury a sentence at the bottom of 47 lines of text saying it can change any term at any time for any reason, the market is broken.</p> </blockquote> <p>Over the next two years, the economy collapsed, Democrats gained control of Congress and the White House, and Warren grew famous criticizing big banks in congressional hearings. She lobbied Democrats to include her agency in their Wall Street&#x2013;reform legislation, arguing that effective enforcement of consumer-protection laws required a regulator independent from politicians beholden to the financial industry. The Democrats had a better idea: They would make her agency independent from Republicans.</p> <div> </div> <p>Circumventing the Constitution took two steps. First, Democrats inserted a few <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ203/pdf/PLAW-111publ203.pdf" target="_blank">clever workarounds into the Dodd-Frank Act</a>, which created the CFPB on July 21, 2010. Commissions such as the one Warren first proposed are ostensibly bipartisan, so a president-appointed director would lead the new agency. Since there might be a Republican president one day, the director would be practically irremovable after Senate confirmation to a five-year term that could extend indefinitely until the next director&#x2019;s confirmation. To prevent future Republican-led Congresses from cutting the bureau&#x2019;s budget, funding would be guaranteed through Federal Reserve profits rather than taxpayer dollars.</p> <p>Next, the enlarged new agency would be <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/24/100-percent-cfpb-donations-went-to-democrats.html" target="_blank">staffed with Democrats, top to bottom</a>. There would not be a Republican director nominee for at least five years, and if one was ever confirmed, entrenched left-wing managers could undermine &#x201C;attempts to weaken consumer protection.&#x201D; The plan wasn&#x2019;t perfect, but it was pretty good.</p> <p><span>Exclusion</span><br> Warren, who had hoped to be the CFPB&#x2019;s first director, led the one-year agency-building process. She chose loyal Democrats to be her senior deputies; they hired like-minded middle managers, who in turn screened lower-level job seekers. It was too risky for interviewers to discuss politics, so mistakes were possible. I was one of them.</p> <p>As a Jewish graduate of a liberal college living on Manhattan&#x2019;s Upper West Side, I fit the stereotypical Democratic profile. In fact, my primary influences were my business-school professors at the University of Chicago, the epicenter of free-market capitalism. I supported the agency Warren proposed in 2007 for the same reason I had worked at the Securities and Exchange Commission &#x2014; accurate information improves markets&#x2019; efficiency. I had not read important sentences at the bottom of the Dodd-Frank Act&#x2019;s thousands of lines of text.</p> <p>In March of 2011, I interviewed with Richard Cordray, the pre-operational agency&#x2019;s new enforcement chief. By May, I had surrendered my prized rent-stabilized apartment and moved to Washington to be the CFPB&#x2019;s 13th enforcement attorney.</p> <p>I would not have been so lucky two months later. As screening techniques improved, Republicans were more easily identified and rejected. Political discrimination was not necessarily illegal, but attempts to hide it invited prohibited race, gender, religion, and age discrimination. In retrospect, the Office of Enforcement&#x2019;s hiring process, which was typical for the bureau, violated more laws than a bar-exam hypothetical.</p> <blockquote>As screening techniques improved, Republicans were more easily identified and rejected.</blockquote> <p>Job seekers interviewed with two pairs of attorneys and most senior managers. All Office of Enforcement employees were invited to attend the weekly hiring meetings, where interviewers summarized the applicants. Any attendee could voice an opinion before each candidate&#x2019;s verdict was rendered; even a single strong objection was usually fatal. Note taking was strictly forbidden, and interviewers destroyed their records after the meetings. I never missed one.</p> <p>Clear verbal and non-verbal signals quickly emerged. The most common, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think he believes in the mission&#x201D; was code for &#x201C;he might not be a Democrat.&#x201D; At one meeting, Kent Markus, a former Clinton-administration lawyer who had joined the bureau as Cordray&#x2019;s deputy, remarked that an applicant under consideration &#x201C;sounds like a good liberal to me.&#x201D; After a few seconds of nervous laughter and eye contact around the room, Markus recognized his slip. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t say that,&#x201D; he awkwardly joked. The episode so unnerved one attorney that he never attended another hiring meeting.</p> <p>Applicants who had represented financial-industry clients were routinely rejected, depriving the bureau of critical expertise and business perspective. A memorable exception sought to become only the second African-American female enforcement attorney. Following an hour-long debate that would have doomed most applicants, her verdict was postponed pending additional interviews. Her prospects looked good at a subsequent meeting until someone expressed concerns over her frequent use of the F word. She survived a second excruciating hour of debate, and worked for the CFPB just long enough to become a partner at a big law firm.</p> <p>White men over 40 received the opposite treatment. One attorney&#x2019;s r&#xE9;sum&#xE9; was so spectacular that interviewers struggled to come up with plausible excuses to reject him. Finally, someone blurted out, &#x201C;For the love of God, don&#x2019;t hire him!&#x201D; Cordray, who always spoke last, had no choice. He asked that the rejection letter be delayed until he could call the Supreme Court justice who had left a voicemail recommending the man.</p> <p><img alt="President Obama with Warren and CFPB nominee Richard Cordray, July 18, 2011. (Jason Reed/Reuters)" src="https://www.nationalreview.com/sites/default/files/cfpb-warren-obama-cordray.jpg"></p> <p><span>Coronation</span><br> Warren would have faced less opposition to being the chair of a bipartisan commission, and might have been confirmed before the 2010 midterm elections restored Republicans&#x2019; Senate filibuster and House majority. Instead, her efforts to charm Congress failed and she was heartbroken when the president declined to nominate her as director. She left the agency she had conceived and nurtured on its birthday, July 21, 2011. Biblical allusions to original sin and expulsion from the Garden of Eden were spoiled when she was elected Massachusetts&#x2019; junior senator later that year.</p> <p>On July 17, 2011, the president nominated Cordray to lead the bureau. The soft-spoken Ohio Democrat and University of Chicago alumnus &#x2014; a former <em>Jeopardy</em> champion and state attorney general who had clerked for Judge Robert Bork and two conservative Supreme Court justices &#x2014; was literally and strategically a smart choice.</p> <p>But in the rush to pass the Dodd-Frank Act, Democrats had made a drafting error that limited the CFPB&#x2019;s most important powers until the bureau had its first director. Republicans vowed to use that leverage to filibuster any nomination until Democrats revised the bureau&#x2019;s structure and funding.</p> <p>Cordray was preparing for his confirmation hearing when I e-mailed him one of my favorite Ronald Reagan quotes:</p> <blockquote> <p>Free men engaged in free enterprise build better nations with more and better goods and services, higher wages and higher standards of living for more people. But free enterprise is not a hunting license.</p> </blockquote> <p>He still hadn&#x2019;t decided how to use the quote when I bumped into him in the office late one night. I asked if he was studying harder than he had for <em>Jeopardy</em>, and for the next half hour he reeled off almost every question he&#x2019;d been asked a quarter-century earlier. He seemed as impressed by my correct answers as I was by his memory.</p> <p>On January 4, 2012, the president bypassed the filibuster with a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/26/justice/supreme-court-recess-appointments/" target="_blank">legally suspect</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/us/politics/richard-cordray-named-consumer-chief-in-recess-appointment.html" target="_blank">recess appointment</a>. Cordray used my Reagan quote in the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/testimony-of-richard-cordray-before-the-u-s-senate-committee-on-banking-housing-and-urban-affairs/" target="_blank">opening statement</a> of his first Senate testimony as director. Finally, on July 16, 2013, with the Supreme Court decision that clarified the recess appointment&#x2019;s unconstitutionality a year away and Democrats threatening to eliminate the filibuster through a change in Senate rules, Republicans abandoned the fight. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/senate-confirms-consumer-watchdog-nominee-richard-cordray/2013/07/16/965d82c2-ee2b-11e2-a1f9-ea873b7e0424_story.html?utm_term=.6ebc92df3ea0" target="_blank">Cordray was confirmed, intensifying partisan acrimony</a>.</p> <p><span>Secrecy</span><br> From 2011 to 2016, Republicans regularly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/business/dealbook/a-dodd-frank-rollback-bill-clears-a-house-committee.html?_r=0" target="_blank">passed legislation to restructure the CFPB</a> as a bipartisan commission and bring its funding under the congressional appropriations process. Democrats labeled and rejected all changes as attempts to weaken consumer protection.</p> <p>The CFPB itself was defined by this existential threat, driven to paranoid secrecy and obsessive self-promotion. It viewed Republican legislative-oversight initiatives as insincere attacks, sometimes appropriately so. But its stonewalling of Congress, and even of its own inspector general, was shocking.</p> <p>A knowledgeable friend within the bureau once debriefed me on the unit that handled oversight requests. The unwritten policy of its supervising attorneys, and in particular of one former Democratic Senate staffer, was &#x201C;never give them what they ask for.&#x201D; When the inspector general complained to Cordray about that supervisor, Cordray took no action because she had accepted a job in the White House. Another former Democratic staffer replaced her. Soon, a career professional in the unit who had resisted pressure to engage in witness coaching and other unethical practices was reprimanded for insubordination and reassigned. The inspector general investigated and issued a report to Cordray that concluded the reprimand was unwarranted and the supervisors had engaged in obstruction.</p> <p>My own experience as a House Financial Services Committee staffer in 2015 left me no doubt the debriefing was accurate. In one episode, unbeknownst to the CFPB, the committee had obtained internal documents that showed the bureau planned to send discrimination-restitution checks to thousands of Caucasian car buyers &#x2014; the only way to distribute the restitution fund it had extracted from an auto-finance company based on trumped-up allegations that car dealers had charged higher interest rates on loans to minority customers. The committee&#x2019;s chairman sent Cordray a letter precisely describing and requesting the documents and related information. I was appalled by the response.</p> <p>The oversight lawyers sent almost none of the requested information or documents, together with a letter from Cordray pretending the bureau had provided everything. I spent days drafting e-mails demanding either the omitted items or a declaration that they did not exist. Each time, the supervisor simply replied that the chairman&#x2019;s inquiry was &#x201C;better suited&#x201D; to a private briefing with committee staff. Subsequent committee subpoenas fared no better. CFPB enforcement attorneys would have bankrupted a company whose lawyers used similar tactics to stonewall the bureau.</p> <p><img alt="Cordray testifies on the CFPB&apos;s first semi-annual report, January 31, 2012. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)" src="https://www.nationalreview.com/sites/default/files/cfpb-cordray-b.jpg"></p> <p><span>Publicity</span><br> The flip side of the CFPB&#x2019;s secrecy was its single-minded pursuit of publicity. External Affairs was the bureau&#x2019;s most powerful division. Headlines drove and often hindered decision-making and operations, as I witnessed first hand.</p> <p>Shortly after his nomination, Cordray gathered senior enforcement attorneys to discuss an <a href="http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-wells-process-1040383-1.html" target="_blank">op-ed by Bill McLucas</a>, my first SEC enforcement director. The piece urged the CFPB to adopt the SEC&#x2019;s Wells process and allow potential defendants to submit their cases directly to the director before he approved lawsuits and other enforcement actions. Everyone at the table rejected the idea, but I stressed the importance of fairness and due process, especially when legal expenses could destroy an innocent defendant. Cordray agreed. I would draft the procedures.</p> <p>The working group added restrictions to discourage submissions, like strict page limits and a 14-day deadline. I named it the Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise, or NORA, process. Everybody liked the friendly, feminine acronym.</p> <p>However, External Affairs decided &#x201C;NORA&#x201D; wasn&#x2019;t testing well with journalists, and renamed it &#x201C;Early Warning Notice.&#x201D; On Saturday, two days before the November 7, 2011 <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-plans-to-provide-early-warning-of-possible-enforcement-actions/" target="_blank">Early Warning Notice press release</a> and media call, the general counsel&#x2019;s office sent an e-mail postponing the rollout due to legal concerns. Minutes later, External Affairs replied that it was not their problem and there would be no postponement.</p> <p>Within days of the rollout, a company threatened to sue for trademark infringement, and the original name was restored. I wish I could report that a NORA submission ever persuaded the director to decline an enforcement action.</p> <p><span>Misery</span><br> 2011 was a wonderful time to work at the CFPB. Most of the employees had emigrated from distant cities, and they became each other&#x2019;s second families. Five attorneys huddled with me in a small office dubbed the &#x201C;Meat Locker&#x201D; for its arctic air conditioning, and then changed locations every few weeks. My favorite was the &#x201C;Warren Room,&#x201D; a cluster of twelve cubicles permeated by non-stop clatter from a nearby ping-pong table.</p> <p>We pitched ideas for the first investigations. Mine involved the currency-exchange rates credit cards use to convert foreign charges to U.S. dollars. Loud boos and cries of &#x201C;Who cares about rich tourists?&#x201D; filled the room. I argued that many international travelers are students and retirees, and the law protects everyone. Plus, we <em>should</em> show wealthier people the CFPB helps them, too. Cordray agreed, and approved my investigation.</p> <p>Things changed after the recess appointment. Markus, the new enforcement chief, exacerbated hiring biases by soliciting anonymous oral comments about colleagues competing for twelve mid-level supervisor positions. Similar illegal practices throughout the bureau resulted in a dearth of real-world experience, and then socialistic management schemes camouflaged by new-age nomenclature.</p> <blockquote>There were a few winners, most with political connections, and many more losers. Moderates who objected were marginalized or ostracized.</blockquote> <p>Enforcement had issue groups, issue teams, working groups, strategy teams, investigation teams, and litigation teams. Individual initiative was forbidden &#x2014; investigation ideas were to be submitted to the collective even before preliminary Internet research. An issue group took custody of my exchange-rate investigation and aborted it.</p> <p>The &#x201C;us against the world&#x201D; culture that was exhilarating in a startup became debilitating in a mature agency. Internal policies to minimize record-keeping deprived the CFPB&#x2019;s enemies of statistics, but limited management tools. External criticism was dismissed as disingenuous, good advice ignored. Problems that could not be acknowledged could not be fixed. Morale and productivity deteriorated. The employees unionized.</p> <p>There were a few winners, most with political connections, and many more losers. Moderates who objected were marginalized or ostracized.</p> <p>Leonard Chanin, a 20-year veteran of the Federal Reserve, was the rulemaking division&#x2019;s first leader. During meetings, I was humbled by his dignified intellect and mastery of financial laws. In 2013, I asked him why he&#x2019;d left the bureau. With characteristic understatement, he replied, &#x201C;I thought it was going to be a professional agency.&#x201D;</p> <p>Other employees had fewer options. I once shared a cab with an enforcement attorney who&#x2019;d had several drinks and was so despondent over her treatment at work that I was terrified she would harm herself.</p> <p><span>Discrimination</span><br> During my job interview, Cordray asked what I thought Enforcement should do first. I said there was plenty of low-hanging fruit like credit-report errors, inscrutable fine print, and fraud to keep us busy until the skeptics got comfortable. He agreed.</p> <p>Car dealers were the highest-hanging fruit &#x2014; the Dodd-Frank Act explicitly exempted them from the CFPB&#x2019;s jurisdiction. A month after his recess appointment, Cordray approved a resource-intensive campaign to stop dealers from negotiating interest rates on car loans, a critical profit source. The <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-rogue-regulator/article/2000932" target="_blank">comically aggressive plan</a> involved guessing car buyers&#x2019; races from their names and addresses, using manipulated statistics and the controversial disparate-impact legal doctrine to label dealer lending discriminatory, and accusing finance companies of discrimination for purchasing dealers&#x2019; loans at competitive market prices.</p> <p>The original and least controversial use of the disparate-impact doctrine, which allows discrimination to be proven by statistics alone, was in employment cases. Unfortunately, a September 2013 confidential Deloitte consulting report found that CFPB minority employees received below-average performance-review scores &#x2014; much stronger disparate-impact evidence than the bureau was using for dealers. Union officials were briefed on, but not given, <a href="http://www.housingwire.com/articles/30071-new-evidence-shows-cfpb-knew-about-discrimination-well-before-ab-article" target="_blank">the report</a>.</p> <p>Cordray still had not fixed the performance-review system on March 6, 2014, when a perfect storm of the CFPB&#x2019;s flaws erupted. The <a href="http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/179_44/cfpb-staff-evaluations-show-sharp-racial-disparities-1066045-1.html" target="_blank">report&#x2019;s findings were leaked to the media</a>, and Republicans pounced. During several embarrassing congressional hearings, employees described disturbing discrimination problems at the agency, like a unit nicknamed &#x201C;<a href="http://www.cutimes.com/2014/04/02/witness-details-alleged-cfpb-gender-racial-discrim?slreturn=1482113794" target="_blank">the Plantation.</a>&#x201D;</p> <p>That summer, I ran into a CFPB-union official who had shivered with me in the Meat Locker three years earlier. I said Cordray&#x2019;s senior managers must have been keeping him in the dark. &#x201C;No,&#x201D; he replied, &#x201C;Rich knows everything, the smallest details. He&#x2019;s changed. He&#x2019;s over at the White House playing basketball with the president. He&#x2019;s not the same guy.&#x201D;</p> <p>Following the hearings, the CFPB attorney who had defended the bureau against Equal Employment Opportunity claims was chosen to run its EEO program. Another year passed before an African American woman in the EEO office testified to Congress that the <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-114-ba09-wstate-fwilliams-20150625.pdf" target="_blank">problems had worsened</a>; the CFPB was more concerned with preventing bad publicity than with preventing discrimination.</p> <p><img alt="Cordray testifies about CFPB management culture, July 30, 2014. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)" src="https://www.nationalreview.com/sites/default/files/cfpb-cordray.jpg"></p> <p><span>Abuse</span><br> The Dodd-Frank Act prohibited &#x201C;abusive acts or practices&#x201D; that take unreasonable advantage of someone&#x2019;s inability to protect their interests. The prohibition did not apply to the CFPB.</p> <p>Enforcement was still hiring and training attorneys when the recess appointment was announced at the beginning of 2012. Critical procedures had not been written, there was no management structure, and administrative trials were a distant dream.</p> <p>Around that time, the Department of Housing and Urban Development transferred its investigation of PHH, a huge mortgage originator, to the CFPB. Most laws contain a statute of limitations that prevents lawsuits from being filed too many years after alleged violations occurred. Chuckles and sighs of relief filled Enforcement&#x2019;s weekly meeting after an attorney announced that PHH had granted him a &#x201C;tolling agreement&#x201D; to temporarily stop the statute-of-limitations clock. Somebody sneered, &#x201C;Suckers!&#x201D;</p> <p>In May of 2012, PHH received a massive civil investigative demand &#x2014; basically, a subpoena for documents and information issued by government agencies such as the CFPB. Enforcement&#x2019;s brutal Rules of Investigation gave the company 20 days to review the interrogatories and document requests, meet with enforcement attorneys, and petition the director to scale back the CID. Cordray denied PHH&#x2019;s application for a two-week extension of the filing deadline.</p> <p>In July of 2012, I got a call from a law-school classmate who suggested I join his law firm. By September, visitors to my new office at the firm could read Cordray&#x2019;s recommendation letter, which hung next to a photo of us shaking hands moments after he was sworn in.</p> <blockquote>Critical procedures had not been written, there was no management structure, and administrative trials were a distant dream.</blockquote> <p>On September 20, 2012, <a href="http://www.dykema.com/assets/htmldocuments/201209_cfpb_setaside_phhcorp_0001.pdf" target="_blank">Cordray issued his decision rejecting all of PHH&#x2019;s modification requests</a>. I had doubts about the opinion, which appeared to punish the company&#x2019;s defiance, even before I ran into one of PHH&#x2019;s lawyers the following January. I asked what had gone wrong. &#x201C;Nothing,&#x201D; he replied. &#x201C;We just assumed the CFPB conducted itself like other agencies.&#x201D;</p> <p>A month later, I understood. My first CFPB-target client was a small-business owner whose twelve-year commercial relationship with a local bank was governed by the same law PHH would later be accused of violating. In 2011, the bank&#x2019;s regulator had withdrawn its blessing from the arrangement, charged the bank a small fine, and transferred jurisdiction to the bureau. The file collected dust for over a year before Enforcement asked the man to sign a tolling agreement that only a lawyer would recognize as permanent. Fortunately, he contacted me first.</p> <p>The man felt he&#x2019;d done nothing wrong, but uncertainty about the investigation would force him to lay off employees. I called the enforcement attorney and offered to come right over and discuss a settlement. When I declined the tolling agreement, he said I had a conflict of interest, hung up, and spent the next month trying to find one. He gave up after I reminded his supervisors that interfering with my client&#x2019;s constitutional right to counsel was a serious ethics violation.</p> <p>For the first two hours of the subsequent settlement conference, the attorney refused to discuss a settlement, and continued to press for the tolling agreement. I insisted he make an offer. Finally, he did &#x2014; ten times more than the bank had paid. I accepted and asked for the settlement documents. Instead, the next day he sent a civil complaint and threatened to sue within 24 hours if my client didn&#x2019;t sign a tolling agreement.</p> <p>I replied that my client wanted to make a NORA submission before the director approved the lawsuit. No scenario could have been more appropriate: The legal expenses would crush the man&#x2019;s business and cost employees their jobs; he&#x2019;d had no opportunity to present evidence or tell Cordray his side of the story; and Enforcement hadn&#x2019;t even conducted an investigation.</p> <p>The response was swift. I was informed that the NORA process was discretionary and the director felt it was not in the bureau&#x2019;s interests to let my client present his case &#x2014; request denied. The poor man signed a tolling agreement, but not the irrevocable one Enforcement had sent him before he had a lawyer.</p> <p><span>Injustice</span><br> During my first-year legal-ethics seminar, we discussed a scene from <em>A Man for All Seasons</em> in which Will Roper urges Sir Thomas More to arrest Richard Rich, an evil man who has broken no laws. When Roper says he would cut down every law in England to get at the Devil, More replies:</p> <blockquote> <p>Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you &#x2014; where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?</p> </blockquote> <p>Bruce Mann, Professor Warren&#x2019;s husband, taught the seminar. Perhaps the film&#x2019;s ending &#x2014; More&#x2019;s execution based on Rich&#x2019;s perjured testimony &#x2014; inspired Warren to cut down the Constitution to get at the banks.</p> <p>SEC enforcement attorneys are often asked, &#x201C;Is my client a target?&#x201D; They&#x2019;re trained to respond, &#x201C;SEC investigations are a search for the truth &#x2014; they don&#x2019;t have targets, they have subjects.&#x201D; In 2011, I mentioned CFPB attorneys&#x2019; exclusive use of &#x201C;target&#x201D; to Cordray. He liked the SEC&#x2019;s practice, and approved the internal procedure I had written to adopt it. Whenever he slipped and used &#x201C;target&#x201D; at meetings, he smiled and corrected himself.</p> <p>By 2013, no other label worked. For each issue the strategy team identified, one or two companies were investigated. The CFPB&#x2019;s complaint database contained grievances against almost every financial business. Enforcement targeted the companies with the most revenue &#x2014; what it called the &#x201C;chokepoints&#x201D; &#x2014; rather than those with the most complaints.</p> <p>Enforcement&#x2019;s internal procedures restricted the contents of investigation files, about the only thing the CFPB had to turn over to defendants before administrative trials. One of the procedures&#x2019; drafters told me that withholding exculpatory evidence from targets was ethical because the bureau was like any civil litigant &#x2014; it did everything it could within the law to win.</p> <p>Targets were almost certain to write a check, especially if they were accused of subjective &#x201C;unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.&#x201D; Even the size of the checks didn&#x2019;t depend on actual wrongdoing &#x2014; during investigations, Enforcement demanded targets&#x2019; financial statements to calculate the maximum fines they could afford to pay.</p> <p>Defendants who chose to fight the bureau could not seek relief in federal court until all administrative processes were exhausted, despite those processes&#x2019; being a farce &#x2014; Floyd Mayweather Jr. would envy Enforcement&#x2019;s record in appeals to the director. And even if a case did make it that far, the courts were bound to defer to the director&#x2019;s judgment unless he had clearly misinterpreted a law. With no meaningful opportunity to defend themselves, many businesses were forced to pay millions of dollars, regardless of guilt or harm to consumers.</p> <p><img alt="Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf testifies on Capitol Hill, September 29, 2016. (Gary Cameron/Reuters)" src="https://www.nationalreview.com/sites/default/files/cfpb-stumpf.jpg"></p> <p><span>Neglect</span><br> Despite these advantages, the CFPB&#x2019;s misplaced priorities kept it from protecting consumers during the most widespread fraud in recent history.</p> <p>On September 8, 2016, Wells Fargo paid the CFPB, the Los Angeles city attorney, and the comptroller of the currency $185 million in penalties for bank employees&#x2019; having opened millions of unauthorized customer accounts since 2011. External Affairs&#x2019; media blitz and the bureau&#x2019;s $100 million share of the penalties created the illusion that Enforcement had led a heroic investigation. CFPB supporters, with Pavlovian predictability, shamed Republicans for attempting to weaken the agency.</p> <p>But the settlement reserved only a few million dollars in restitution for victims. Enforcement didn&#x2019;t advance consumer lawsuits by making the bank admit wrongdoing, and it didn&#x2019;t do much to help criminal prosecutors beyond giving the Department of Justice legally mandated evidence.</p> <p>Congressional hearings revealed that two years of examinations, thousands of bank-employee firings, and numerous complaints had failed to get the bureau&#x2019;s attention before the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> published <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wells-fargo-sale-pressure-20131222-story.html" target="_blank">a detailed expos&#xE9;</a> late in 2013. Worse yet, from 2013 to 2016, the CFPB took no action while the bank continued the incentive program that drove the unauthorized account openings. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt, the executive overseeing the program, earned tens of millions of dollars. Tolstedt retired with a huge nest egg two months before the settlement.</p> <p>The CFPB had waited while the city attorney and OCC completed their investigations, and then negotiated its headline-grabbing penalty. A month after the settlement, it was clear that simply taking regulatory action to highlight the severity of the fraud had triggered the real wake-up call for bank executives. Wells Fargo&#x2019;s stock lost billions of dollars in value, and its board clawed back $60 million from Stumpf and Tolstedt before firing Stumpf. The $100 million penalty may deter future violations, but no more so than a smaller fine or a CFPB lawsuit would have three years earlier.</p> <p><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?415547-1/ceo-john-stumpf-testifies-unauthorized-wells-fargo-accounts" target="_blank">During Senate hearings</a>, Cordray implied that Enforcement had stood down because all available personnel were busy investigating deceptive credit-card add-on products and other violations. In doing so, he inadvertently revealed that the campaign to expand the bureau&#x2019;s reach to car dealers had diverted limited resources from mission-critical tasks.</p> <p><span>Reckoning</span><br> Fortunately for PHH, the CFPB had accused it of violating a specific mortgage law. For two decades, HUD had interpreted the law and provided guidance that allowed business relationships like the ones Enforcement had investigated at PHH; payments to the company and its affiliates above the reasonable market value of services rendered were deemed illegal kickbacks. An administrative-law judge, following HUD&#x2019;s interpretation, ordered PHH to refund consumers $6.4 million in excess payments. PHH appealed to the director.</p> <p>Cordray&#x2019;s decision was stunning: HUD&#x2019;s interpretation was wrong; the CFPB was not bound by the mortgage law&#x2019;s three-year statute of limitations; all payments during the last eight years were kickbacks; PHH didn&#x2019;t owe $6.4 million, it owed $109 million.</p> <p>Centuries before a 2016 Nobel Prize winner catalogued the havoc wrought by government officials with God on their side, the founding fathers put checks and balances into the Constitution to limit it. By demonstrating the inevitable consequences of absolute power, Cordray had invited the appellate court to revoke it.</p> <p>Parts of the decision by the three-judge panel were obvious: HUD&#x2019;s interpretation of the law was correct; Cordray&#x2019;s attempt to reinterpret it retroactively violated PHH&#x2019;s due-process rights; the CFPB could not disregard deadlines in the laws it enforced. The rest of <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/AAC6BFFC4C42614C852580490053C38B/$file/15-1177-1640101.pdf" target="_blank">Judge Brett Kavanaugh&#x2019;s 100-page opinion</a>, an eloquent dissertation on liberty, democracy, and justice, answered questions that had been debated for six years. The people elect the president. Executive agencies report to the president, who can remove their leaders at will. While the president cannot remove members of independent commissions, their power is tempered by bipartisan collaboration and transparency. The Dodd-Frank Act made the CFPB&#x2019;s unelected director &#x201C;the single most powerful official in the entire U.S. Government, other than the President,&#x201D; and arguably more powerful in consumer financial-protection matters. The Constitution permits single-director executive agencies and independent commissions, but not single-director independent agencies. The most important words in the opinion were buried in footnote twelve: &#x201C;An agency structure must be adjudged on the basis of what it permits to happen.&#x201D;</p> <blockquote>By demonstrating the inevitable consequences of absolute power, Cordray had invited the appellate court to revoke it.</blockquote> <p>Judge Kavanaugh&#x2019;s remedy was simple: He struck 18 words from the Dodd-Frank Act and announced, &#x201C;The President of the United States now has the power to supervise and direct the Director of the CFPB, and may remove the Director at will at any time.&#x201D; If the ruling were upheld, Warren&#x2019;s agency would lose its independence. Democrats shrugged; they would undo the decision after winning the election, just 28 days away.</p> <p>Shimon Peres&#x2019;s death brought to mind parallels between the CFPB and the state of Israel. Both were established during a brief window of political opportunity created by sympathy for the victims of a catastrophe, both defined by existential threat, and both criticized for territorial expansion. Both might also have used the land-for-peace formula to resolve longstanding conflicts.</p> <p>The CFPB&#x2019;s metaphoric swap was Democrats&#x2019; restructuring the bureau as a bipartisan commission in exchange for Republicans&#x2019; recognizing the agency&#x2019;s independence by blessing funding through the Federal Reserve. Unlike Israel, Democrats never offered the deal, even after losing everything but their Senate filibuster in the election.</p> <p>Instead, on November 18, 2016, the CFPB <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/business/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-fights-a-ruling-on-its-constitutionality.html?_r=1" target="_blank">petitioned the full court of appeals</a> to rehear the case. If that fails, Democrats hope to exclude Republicans until Cordray&#x2019;s term ends in 2018, or even until the 2020 election, by appealing to the Supreme Court. The strategy assumes President Trump cannot remove Cordray for cause &#x2014; &#x201C;inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.&#x201D;</p> <p><span>Epilogue</span><br> Late one evening in 2012, I entered the Farragut North metro station a few steps behind Cordray, who was talking on his cell phone. I kept my distance on the long descending escalator, but overheard snippets of the conversation. &#x201C;That good plan, Kemosabe.&#x201D; &#x201C;You plenty wise, Kemosabe.&#x201D; I remember thinking that his twelve-year-old son couldn&#x2019;t possibly appreciate how lucky he was.</p> <p>Four years later, on March 16, 2016, <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=400449" target="_blank">Cordray testified</a> before the House Financial Services Committee, which had published its copies of the <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/hearingslegislation/staff-reports.htm" target="_blank">documents the CFPB refused to provide</a> because the chairman&#x2019;s requests were &#x201C;better suited to a briefing.&#x201D; Representative Sean Duffy asked several pointed questions about the blatant stonewalling. Under oath, Cordray replied, &#x201C;If you ask for responsive documents in an area, we give you the responsive documents we can.&#x201D;</p> <p><span><em>&#x2014; Ronald L.

While Facebook has historically grown at a very fast clip, the company is now in a position that it needs to find additional ways to create value for investors beyond just trying to expand its user base and gather more eyeballs to put ads in front of.</p> <p>For Facebook, keeping control of the company doesn&#x2019;t necessarily seem like an issue. Earlier this year, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/27/facebook-is-adding-a-new-class-of-stock-that-will-help-keep-zuckerberg-in-control/" target="_blank">issued a new class of stock</a> that would essentially keep Mark Zuckerberg in control of the company, enabling him to outmaneuver any kind of heavy pressure from Wall Street. That means Facebook can essentially continue to make long-term plays &#x2014; while that may be to the chagrin of industry watchers and investors. However, share repurchases can sometimes be useful for reducing the overall amount of outstanding shares.</p> <p>Companies can authorize a share repurchase for a number of reasons. For one, it represents an opportunity for the company to return value to shareholders (the company can also issue a dividend), which may be agitating the company to do something in order to build up good will with Wall Street. A near-term buyback can buy Facebook time to keep pressure off the company while investing in longer-term plays, such as growing its other platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp and investing in virtual reality.</p> <p>In fact, Facebook pretty much spells that out <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680116000093/form8-knovember2016.htm" target="_blank">in its filing with the SEC</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>&#x201C;The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities,&#x201D; the company said in its filing. &#x201C;The program will be executed consistent with the Company&#x2019;s capital allocation strategy of prioritizing investment to grow the business over the long term.&#x201D;</p></blockquote> <p>In some cases, share buybacks may even be a result from pressure from investors. For example, around 2013 activist investor Carl Icahn pressured Apple to buy back more shares in an effort to return value to shareholders. Facebook shares are up around 9% year-over-year, but it hasn&#x2019;t seen the crazy levels of growth it&#x2019;s had historically (the shares are up almost 60% over the past two years).</p><div><div></div></div> <p>Facebook has been sitting on a large cash pile. With $26 billion sitting in the bank, investors may be impatient with the company&#x2019;s use of that cash even while it invests heavily in growth and research and development. This is a perpetual optics issue with Apple, which has amassed a cash pile of more than $200 billion.</p> <div> <a href="http://listings.findthecompany.com/l/14143267/Facebook-Inc-in-Menlo-Park-CA" target="_blank">FindTheCompany | Graphiq</a> </div> <p>Facebook, which saw its shares decline after its most-recent earnings, may have an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone as it picks shares back up at a lower price. There&#x2019;s no specific schedule for the stock buyback, so it can essentially make a repurchase whenever it wants. Following the announcement, shares of Facebook were up around 2%, though they have dropped to now remain largely unchanged.</p> <p>The company also said that its chief accounting officer, Jas Athwal, would be leaving the company after serving at the company for nearly 9 years <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680116000094/form8-kcaonovember2016.htm" target="_blank">in a separate filing</a>.</p> Featured Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images </div> <div> <ul> <li> <h5>0</h5><br> SHARES </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> </ul> </div> <div></div> <div></div> <div> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/advertise/" target="_blank"> Advertisement </a> <div></div> <div></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/advertise/" target="_blank"> Advertisement </a> <div></div> </div> <div> <h2> Newsletter Subscriptions </h2> <div> <div> <div> <span></span> <strong>The Daily Crunch</strong> <span>Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox</span> <span></span> <strong>TC Weekly Roundup</strong> <span>Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories</span> <span></span> <strong>Crunchbase Daily</strong> <span>The latest startup funding announcements</span> </div> Enter Address Subscribe </div> </div> </div> <h2> Latest <span>Crunch Report</span> </h2> <div> <ul> <li> <div> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/tesla-acquisition-of-solarcity-approved-crunch-report/582e4949134aa15f420ded1b/?ncid=rightrail_cr" target="_blank"> <img src="https://img.vidible.tv/prod/2016-11/18/582e4949134aa15f420ded1b_o_U_v1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=170" alt="Tesla Acquisition of SolarCity Approved | Crunch Report"> <div> <h3>Tesla Acquisition of SolarCity Approved | Crunch Report</h3> </div> </a> </div> </li> </ul> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/crunchreport/?ncid=rightrail_crmore" target="_blank">Watch More Episodes<i></i></a> </div> <div> <div></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <ul> <li> <div> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/topic/company/facebook/" target="_blank"> Facebook </a> </div> </li> <li> <div> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/apps/" target="_blank"> Apps </a> </div> </li> <li> <div><a target="_blank">Popular Posts</a></div> <div> <div></div> <ul> <div></div> </ul> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>`

  //       return `I am a movie fanatic. When friends want to know what picture won the Oscar in 1980 or who played the police chief in Jaws, they ask me. My friends, though, have stopped asking me if I want to go out to the movies. The problems in getting to the theater, the theater itself, and the behavior of some patrons are all reasons why I often wait for a movie to show up on TV.
  // First of all, just getting to the theater presents difficulties. Leaving a home equipped with a TV and a video recorder isn't an attractive idea on a humid, cold, or rainy night. Even if the weather cooperates, there is still a thirty-minute drive to the theater down a congested highway, followed by the hassle of looking for a parking space. And then there are the lines. After hooking yourself to the end of a human chain, you worry about whether there will be enough tickets, whether you will get seats together, and whether many people will sneak into the line ahead of you.
  // Once you have made it to the box office and gotten your tickets, you are confronted with the problems of the theater itself. If you are in one of the run-down older theaters, you must adjust to the musty smell of seldom-cleaned carpets. Escaped springs lurk in the faded plush or cracked leather seats, and half the seats you sit in seem loose or tilted so that you sit at a strange angle. The newer twin and quad theaters offer their own problems. Sitting in an area only one-quarter the size of a regular theater, moviegoers often have to put up with the sound of the movie next door. This is especially jarring when the other movie involves racing cars or a karate war and you are trying to enjoy a quiet love story. And whether the theater is old or new, it will have floors that seem to be coated with rubber cement. By the end of a movie, shoes almost have to be pried off the floor because they have become sealed to a deadly compound of spilled soda, hardening bubble gum, and crushed Ju-Jubes.
  // Some of the patrons are even more of a problem than the theater itself. Little kids race up and down the aisles, usually in giggling packs. Teenagers try to impress their friends by talking back to the screen, whistling, and making what they consider to be hilarious noises. Adults act as if they were at home in their own living rooms and comment loudly on the ages of the stars or why movies aren't as good anymore. And people of all ages crinkle candy wrappers, stick gum on their seats, and drop popcorn tubs or cups of crushed ice and soda on the floor. They also cough and burp, squirm endlessly in their seats, file out for repeated trips to the rest rooms or concession stand, and elbow you out of the armrest on either side of your seat.
  // After arriving home from the movies one night, I decided that I was not going to be a moviegoer anymore. I was tired of the problems involved in getting to the movies and dealing with the theater itself and some of the patrons. The next day I arranged to have cable TV service installed in my home. I may now see movies a bit later than other people, but I'll be more relaxed watching box office hits in the comfort of my own living room.`

        return `Officer Pedro Alexander of the Youngsville, La., police department likes publicity, so allow me to give him a little right here: He ought to be fired, along with a few of his colleagues and supervisors. Officer Alexander is one of the many policemen around the country who, having decided that the daily ritual humiliations Americans endure at the hands of their government (at the airport, at the motor-vehicles office, getting a passport renewed) should be even more extensive — and, by God, jollier! — are going around conducting illegal police stops as part of a Christmas-themed public-relations campaign. Our friends at Reason have been following these shenanigans for a while, and they are widespread, perpetrated by police from Louisiana to Pennsylvania to Oklahoma. What happens is this: Police cruisers pull up behind some unsuspecting citizen who is minding his own business and following the law. The police put on their flashing lights and pull over the unsuspecting citizen who is minding his own business and following the law. Then, they videotape the subsequent encounter between the police and the unsuspecting citizen who is minding his own business and following the law, who breathes a sigh of relief when police say: “Congratulations! You weren’t doing anything wrong! Merry Christmas!” And then sometimes the police give that unsuspecting citizen who is minding his own business and following the law a Red Lobster gift certificate. Some of these videos are hilarious. But do you know why they are hilarious? Because that unsuspecting citizen who is minding his own business and following the law is terrified. That’s part of the mechanics of humor, which works by subverting our expectations (as in a pun or a double-entendre) and by providing a channel for the spasmodic relief of tension. And if you want to create tension, conducting a police stop is a great way to do that. Police officers are armed agents of the state who enjoy a wide license when it comes to performing acts of violence on citizens, which is why traffic stops and other police encounters are so stressful even for those who have done nothing wrong. What is particularly maddening about this is that we are constantly reminded by our occasionally sanctimonious and self-regarding friends in law enforcement that traffic stops are extraordinarily dangerous for police, who are therefore justified in treating them as though each broken-taillight encounter were potentially a standoff with Billy the Kid. Here’s our friend Jack Dunphy, a California police official and regular contributor in these pages: The traffic stop presents some of the greatest dangers a police officer can encounter. Bear in mind that the officer who pulls you over for a minor traffic violation has no idea that you are ordinarily a law-abiding citizen who happens to be in a hurry to get somewhere. Unless, of course, he does know for a fact that you are an unsuspecting citizen who is minding his own business and following the law and has targeted you for that very reason. Maybe we should take police claims of the fraught nature of traffic stops with a grain of salt or three: They don’t seem to believe their own bull***t, so why should we? It is occasionally necessary to remind the people we employ to do necessary violence on our behalf that they are servants and not masters. We should give some brief consideration to the legal and practical questions here: These are illegal stops, but they could very well uncover (other) illegal activity: If Officer Friendly ends up pulling over Jack the Ripper and discovers a severed head in the passenger seat of his minivan, that’s still an illegal stop, which taints evidence uncovered by it — a fact that will occur to Jack’s lawyer. And instead of pulling over to the side of the road to whimper and call you “Sir,” that nice young lady might instead lead you on a high-speed chase and drive her Volvo into a school bus. But what is particularly galling here is the unspoken set of political assumptions behind all this, i.e., that we citizens exist at the sufferance of the state and for the use and amusement of its agents. It is occasionally necessary to remind the people we employ to do necessary violence on our behalf that they are servants and not masters. Police officers are servants, like gardeners and housekeepers, and they work for us. They are handsomely paid and splendidly pensioned, treated with great courtesy and extended an extraordinary (sometimes excessive) degree of respect. But they are not entitled to waste our time, to interfere with us, or to use us as props in their public-relations campaigns. We are subjects, not objects. The proper “reward” for following the rules of the road and for not being a thief or a homicidal maniac is not a ho-ho-ho humorous holiday encounter with the police and a candy cane. It is being left alone. Police officers conducting illegal traffic stops should face consequences. The senior police officials who conceive of these programs and sign off on them should lose their jobs. And we, as citizens, should attempt to rekindle enough self-respect that we insist on being treated by our police officers with at least the same degree of respect and consideration we demand from the people who cut our grass or sell us lattes. They work for us, and we should treat them accordingly. And that means telling Officer Pedro Alexander of Youngsville, La., to mind his own business and do his damned job.`
