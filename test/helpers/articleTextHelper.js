While Facebook has historically grown at a very fast clip, the company is now in a position that it needs to find additional ways to create value for investors beyond just trying to expand its user base and gather more eyeballs to put ads in front of.</p> <p>For Facebook, keeping control of the company doesn&#x2019;t necessarily seem like an issue. Earlier this year, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/27/facebook-is-adding-a-new-class-of-stock-that-will-help-keep-zuckerberg-in-control/" target="_blank">issued a new class of stock</a> that would essentially keep Mark Zuckerberg in control of the company, enabling him to outmaneuver any kind of heavy pressure from Wall Street. That means Facebook can essentially continue to make long-term plays &#x2014; while that may be to the chagrin of industry watchers and investors. However, share repurchases can sometimes be useful for reducing the overall amount of outstanding shares.</p> <p>Companies can authorize a share repurchase for a number of reasons. For one, it represents an opportunity for the company to return value to shareholders (the company can also issue a dividend), which may be agitating the company to do something in order to build up good will with Wall Street. A near-term buyback can buy Facebook time to keep pressure off the company while investing in longer-term plays, such as growing its other platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp and investing in virtual reality.</p> <p>In fact, Facebook pretty much spells that out <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680116000093/form8-knovember2016.htm" target="_blank">in its filing with the SEC</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>&#x201C;The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities,&#x201D; the company said in its filing. &#x201C;The program will be executed consistent with the Company&#x2019;s capital allocation strategy of prioritizing investment to grow the business over the long term.&#x201D;</p></blockquote> <p>In some cases, share buybacks may even be a result from pressure from investors. For example, around 2013 activist investor Carl Icahn pressured Apple to buy back more shares in an effort to return value to shareholders. Facebook shares are up around 9% year-over-year, but it hasn&#x2019;t seen the crazy levels of growth it&#x2019;s had historically (the shares are up almost 60% over the past two years).</p><div><div></div></div> <p>Facebook has been sitting on a large cash pile. With $26 billion sitting in the bank, investors may be impatient with the company&#x2019;s use of that cash even while it invests heavily in growth and research and development. This is a perpetual optics issue with Apple, which has amassed a cash pile of more than $200 billion.</p> <div> <a href="http://listings.findthecompany.com/l/14143267/Facebook-Inc-in-Menlo-Park-CA" target="_blank">FindTheCompany | Graphiq</a> </div> <p>Facebook, which saw its shares decline after its most-recent earnings, may have an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone as it picks shares back up at a lower price. There&#x2019;s no specific schedule for the stock buyback, so it can essentially make a repurchase whenever it wants. Following the announcement, shares of Facebook were up around 2%, though they have dropped to now remain largely unchanged.</p> <p>The company also said that its chief accounting officer, Jas Athwal, would be leaving the company after serving at the company for nearly 9 years <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680116000094/form8-kcaonovember2016.htm" target="_blank">in a separate filing</a>.</p> Featured Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images </div> <div> <ul> <li> <h5>0</h5><br> SHARES </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> <li> <a href="#" target="_blank"></a> </li> </ul> </div> <div></div> <div></div> <div> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/advertise/" target="_blank"> Advertisement </a> <div></div> <div></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/advertise/" target="_blank"> Advertisement </a> <div></div> </div> <div> <h2> Newsletter Subscriptions </h2> <div> <div> <div> <span></span> <strong>The Daily Crunch</strong> <span>Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox</span> <span></span> <strong>TC Weekly Roundup</strong> <span>Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories</span> <span></span> <strong>Crunchbase Daily</strong> <span>The latest startup funding announcements</span> </div> Enter Address Subscribe </div> </div> </div> <h2> Latest <span>Crunch Report</span> </h2> <div> <ul> <li> <div> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/tesla-acquisition-of-solarcity-approved-crunch-report/582e4949134aa15f420ded1b/?ncid=rightrail_cr" target="_blank"> <img src="https://img.vidible.tv/prod/2016-11/18/582e4949134aa15f420ded1b_o_U_v1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=170" alt="Tesla Acquisition of SolarCity Approved | Crunch Report"> <div> <h3>Tesla Acquisition of SolarCity Approved | Crunch Report</h3> </div> </a> </div> </li> </ul> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/crunchreport/?ncid=rightrail_crmore" target="_blank">Watch More Episodes<i></i></a> </div> <div> <div></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <ul> <li> <div> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/topic/company/facebook/" target="_blank"> Facebook </a> </div> </li> <li> <div> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/apps/" target="_blank"> Apps </a> </div> </li> <li> <div><a target="_blank">Popular Posts</a></div> <div> <div></div> <ul> <div></div> </ul> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>`

        return `I am a movie fanatic. When friends want to know what picture won the Oscar in 1980 or who played the police chief in Jaws, they ask me. My friends, though, have stopped asking me if I want to go out to the movies. The problems in getting to the theater, the theater itself, and the behavior of some patrons are all reasons why I often wait for a movie to show up on TV.
  First of all, just getting to the theater presents difficulties. Leaving a home equipped with a TV and a video recorder isn't an attractive idea on a humid, cold, or rainy night. Even if the weather cooperates, there is still a thirty-minute drive to the theater down a congested highway, followed by the hassle of looking for a parking space. And then there are the lines. After hooking yourself to the end of a human chain, you worry about whether there will be enough tickets, whether you will get seats together, and whether many people will sneak into the line ahead of you.
  Once you have made it to the box office and gotten your tickets, you are confronted with the problems of the theater itself. If you are in one of the run-down older theaters, you must adjust to the musty smell of seldom-cleaned carpets. Escaped springs lurk in the faded plush or cracked leather seats, and half the seats you sit in seem loose or tilted so that you sit at a strange angle. The newer twin and quad theaters offer their own problems. Sitting in an area only one-quarter the size of a regular theater, moviegoers often have to put up with the sound of the movie next door. This is especially jarring when the other movie involves racing cars or a karate war and you are trying to enjoy a quiet love story. And whether the theater is old or new, it will have floors that seem to be coated with rubber cement. By the end of a movie, shoes almost have to be pried off the floor because they have become sealed to a deadly compound of spilled soda, hardening bubble gum, and crushed Ju-Jubes.
  Some of the patrons are even more of a problem than the theater itself. Little kids race up and down the aisles, usually in giggling packs. Teenagers try to impress their friends by talking back to the screen, whistling, and making what they consider to be hilarious noises. Adults act as if they were at home in their own living rooms and comment loudly on the ages of the stars or why movies aren't as good anymore. And people of all ages crinkle candy wrappers, stick gum on their seats, and drop popcorn tubs or cups of crushed ice and soda on the floor. They also cough and burp, squirm endlessly in their seats, file out for repeated trips to the rest rooms or concession stand, and elbow you out of the armrest on either side of your seat.
  After arriving home from the movies one night, I decided that I was not going to be a moviegoer anymore. I was tired of the problems involved in getting to the movies and dealing with the theater itself and some of the patrons. The next day I arranged to have cable TV service installed in my home. I may now see movies a bit later than other people, but I'll be more relaxed watching box office hits in the comfort of my own living room.`
